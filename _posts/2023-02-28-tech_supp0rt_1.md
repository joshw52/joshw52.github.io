## TryHackMe Tech_Supp0rt: 1 Walkthrough

I used the TryHackMe AttackBox to work through the [Tech_Supp0rt: 1](https://tryhackme.com/room/techsupp0rt1) room.

Once it booted up, I ran a few commands to do some basic enumeration of the lab machine, starting with the following `nmap` scan of the first 10,000 ports: `nmap -A -T4 -p 1-10000 10.10.104.196`:

```
Nmap scan report for ip-10-10-104-196.eu-west-1.compute.internal (10.10.104.196)

```

From this, I could see that this is running SSH, SMB, and an HTTP server.

I then enumerated the web server further with `Nikto` scan (`nikto -h 10.10.104.196`):

```
+ Server: Apache/2.4.18 (Ubuntu)
+ Server leaks inodes via ETags, header found with file /, fields: 0x2c39 0x5c367f4428b1f

+ End Time:           2023-03-01 03:37:42 (GMT0) (10 seconds)
```

I then ran `gobuster dir -u http://10.10.104.196 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x html,php,txt` to enumerate files and directories, and found a couple interesting directories `test` and `wordpress`:

```
/index.html (Status: 200)
/wordpress (Status: 301)
/test (Status: 301)
/phpinfo.php (Status: 200)
/server-status (Status: 403)
```

I then started browsing some through the pages I found so far.  The main page at `/` was just a default Apache2 page, with no interesting comments in the source code, and the `/phpinfo.php` page revealed the PHP version:

![](/img/tryhackme/tech_supp0rt_1/phpinfo.png)

The page at `/test` was just a bunch of ads for Windows Defender, and I didn't find anything useful in the source code:

![](/img/tryhackme/tech_supp0rt_1/test_page.png)

The page at `/wordpress` looked like a Wordpress tech support page that had been taken down:

![](/img/tryhackme/tech_supp0rt_1/wordpress_page.png)

Then I proceeded to do some SMB enumeration with `nmap --script smb-enum*,smb-vuln* -p 139,445 10.10.104.196`:

```
Nmap scan report for ip-10-10-104-196.eu-west-1.compute.internal (10.10.104.196)

```

This found the shares `IPC$`, `print$`, and `websvr`, and `IPC$` and `websvr` allowed anonymous login.  Didn't find anything exciting in `IPC$`, but `websvr` had an `enter.txt` file, which I downloaded:

![](/img/tryhackme/tech_supp0rt_1/smb_websvr_enum.png)

The `enter.txt` file had some creds for user `admin` on Subrion.  The password looked like it might be encoded in some kind of base64 encoding, although running `echo <encoded_password> | base64 -d` just returned garbled text.

I then tried a number of combinations of baseXX decoding in CyberChef, and eventually got the value:

![](/img/tryhackme/tech_supp0rt_1/decode_enter_text.png)

This returned the password.  Since `Subrion` didn't turn up in any of the previous enumeration, I tried navigating to `http://10.10.104.196/subrion`, but the request just hanged.

I then ran `gobuster dir -u http://10.10.104.196/subrion -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x html,php,txt`:

```

```

There was a `robots.txt` file under `/subrion` that contained the following:

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /backup/
Disallow: /cron/?
Disallow: /front/
Disallow: /install/
Disallow: /panel/
Disallow: /tmp/
Disallow: /updates/
```
Some of these paths wouldn't load when I navigated to them, but `/subrion/panel/` showed a login form, and entering the credentials I found earlier lead to a Dashboard:

![](/img/tryhackme/tech_supp0rt_1/subrion_dashboard.png)

Navigating to `Content > Uploads` showed a section where files could be uploaded.  I also found after looking around the Dashboard that it was using Subrion v4.2.1.  Searching for `Subrion 4.2.1` in `exploit-db.com` returned a number of exploits, including an [Arbitrary File Upload](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49876) exploit.  

Reading through the exploit and the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/intelliants/subrion/issues/801) it links, I found it allowed for uploading `.pht` and `.phar` files.

I then copied the PHP reverse shell template on the AttackBox at `/usr/share/webshells/php/php-reverse-shell.php`, saved it as `shell.phar` (and made another copy with the name `shell.pht`), and updated the IP with the AttackBox's IP address (`10.10.140.3`).  I then ran `nc -lvnp 1234` on the AttackBox.

I uploaded both files to the server:

![](/img/tryhackme/tech_supp0rt_1/subrion_shell_uploads.png)

I tried previewing both files, and while the `shell.pht` file just showed the code, the `shell.phar` triggered the reverse shell on my listener.

![](/img/tryhackme/tech_supp0rt_1/subrion_shell_opened.png)

This got me a shell as `www-data`.  I just needed to find the root.txt flag for this room, so I looked for ways to escalate privileges.  I browsed through `/var/www/html`, finding a number of files and folders, most notably directories for Subrion and Wordpress.  After digging around for a while I found some MySQL Credentials in `/var/www/html/wordpress/wp-config.php`:

![](/img/tryhackme/tech_supp0rt_1/mysql_creds.png)

I logged into MariaDB with user `support` and the password, but for database `wpdb` and table `wp_users`, the user `support` was the only user listed when running `SELECT * FROM wp_users;`.  After exiting MariaDB, I looked through `/etc/passwd`, but there was no user `support`.  I then tried running `su root` using the same password from the database credentials, but couldn't log in as `root`.

I did find a user `scamsite` in `/etc/passwd`, and was able to successfully escalate privileges to user `scamsite` using the database password, although I first ran `python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'` to upgrade my shell before I could run `su scamsite`.

![](/img/tryhackme/tech_supp0rt_1/su_scamsite.png)

After running `sudo -l` and navigating to `/home/scamsite` and looking through the `.bash_history` of `scamsite`, I found I could run `/usr/bin/iconv` as any user, and `scamsite`'s attempt to do so was logged in the `.bash_history`.

I then ran Running this same command returned the `root.txt` flag.
